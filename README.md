## Ten-HUT!

If you're wandering around Mechagon aimlessly, looking for rigs and hoping it spawns the rare you need, then you need discipline! You need order! You need a drill sergeant to keep you in line!

This addon makes your drill wrangling in Mechagon easier in two ways.

First, Drill Sergeant will put the name of the rare that would be spawned in your tooltip when you mouse over a Broken Drill Rig. If you're too far from the broken rig, it will ask you to get closer so it gets an accurate ID.

Second, when a drill rig is completed anywhere in Mechagon, it gives a zonewide announcement. Drill Sergeant will tell you what rare is about to spawn and where to go to get it! You can click the coordinates to get a WoW waypoint or a TomTom arrow, if you have that installed.

Using TomTom arrows:

Using WoW waypoints:

**Bonus!** When you mouse over a mushroom in Mechagon, it will inform you if it spawns the Fungarian Furor!

## Configuration
By default, Drill Sergeant will use TomTom arrows if you have TomTom installed, and WoW waypoints otherwise. You can manually select which one to use with these commands:

`/drill tomtom`

`/drill wow`

## Version Notes
Version 2 adds TomTom integration.

## Known errors
None!

I've tested this add-on in a variety of situations, and it seems to work correctly in all of them. If you encounter any errors, PLEASE open a ticket [here](https://github.com/KyrosKrane/DrillSergeant/issues) including the FULL error message. I also need to know what you were doing when the error happened. Or for live support, [visit my Discord server](https://discord.gg/YRBDrxQ)!
