## Ten-HUT!

If you're wandering around Mechagon aimlessly, looking for rigs and hoping it spawns the rare you need, then you need discipline! You need order! You need a drill sergeant to keep you in line!

This addon makes your drill wrangling in Mechagon easier in two ways.

First, Drill Sergeant will put the name of the rare that would be spawned in your tooltip when you mouse over a Broken Drill Rig. If you're too far from the broken rig, it will ask you to get closer so it gets an accurate ID.

Second, when a drill rig is completed anywhere in Mechagon, it gives a zonewide announcement. Drill Sergeant will tell you what rare is about to spawn and where to go to get it!

There's no configuration or settings; just install it and go!
